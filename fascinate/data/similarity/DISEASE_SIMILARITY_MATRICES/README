Below I describe the strategy used to generate the matrices.

I have first converted DOIDS to UMLS CUIS using the Institute for Genome Sciences (IGS) mapping provided at 
https://github.com/IGS/disease-ontology/blob/master/disease_ontology/code/DO_info_files/doid_xref.txt 


All DOIDS, except the following four, converted sucesfully:

0050425
0050741
0050742
0050156

The four DOIDs above were converted manualy at "www.disease-ontology.org":

DOID:   CUI:

0050425 C0035258
0050741 C0031347
0050742 C0028043
0050156 C1800706

The complete list of DOIDs and corresponding CUI's is given in the file "DOID_CUI.txt". 

To generate similarity matrices, I ran "umls-similarity" software using MeSH vocabulary and PAR/CHD 
relations. I used semantic similarity measures "resnik", "lin" and "path" (these were recommended to me by 
Ted Pedersen, the author of umls-similarity). 

To get a better populated matrix, I also used the "vector" measure, which is the measure of relatedness of terms.
To generate this matrix, I used the disease names in place of CUIs (hence, pay special attention when parsing it,
because the disease names often consist of multiple words). 

For more info on the above measures, see http://atlas.ahc.umn.edu/umls_similarity//similarity_measures.html.

The matrices are stored in the "similarity_matrices" directory. PLEASE NOTE that these are raw, unnormalized matrices. 
They can be easily normalized by setting each -1 score to 0 and then dividing each score by the maximum score
occuring in the matrix.
