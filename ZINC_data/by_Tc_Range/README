This directory contains networks for ZINC data. (For PRW data in a separate directory)
The data in this directory are intended to test performances of algorithms on chemicals with known similarity ranges.
Specifically, we would like to know which algorithm works better for test chemicals having similar chemicals in the training set.
In other words, if chemical A has maximum 0.95 similar chemicals in the training set, chemical B has 0.85 similar chemicals, and chemical C has 0.75 maximum similar chemicals,
we test whether any algorithm works better (or worse) on the chemical A, B, and C.
